# hello-world
This is my introduction to a new world. I'm coming. See you there..
I decided to update my intro and use complete sentences. In the newWorld, I figure we will still speak 
and write in correctSyntax. 
I'm learning...
I'm growing...
I'm going to get this! Believe...Believe...Do...Do...
I will not give up!
